# P_DistortedMessage
Employee L06 was stationed at Checkpoint Kilo-6 for 187 consecutive nights.

On Night 188, automated systems flagged an anomaly: surveillance feed #4 went offline for 37 seconds. Upon restoration, L06 was unresponsive. No breach. No departure. Just absence.
Body never found. Chair still warm.

A week later, a sealed envelope arrived addressed only to “Successor.”
Inside: L06’s access keycard and a small leather-bound diary.

You’ve been assigned to Kilo-6.
Same chair. Same screens. Same silence.

The diary begins with a single line:

“They don’t always appear on camera.”

Observe. Analyze. Report.

# DistortedMessage 
It is a mobile decision-based game built in Unity 6,being developed by a two-person team. The player assumes the role of a lone security officer tasked with monitoring a network of surveillance cameras at an isolated checkpoint.

Core Mechanics

    Camera Feed Switching: Monitor six distinct live feeds, each showing different areas.

    Entity Observation: Randomized entities appear across camera zones, each with subtle behavior and visual traits.

    Report System: Players mark entities as hostile or friendly based on observed behavior. Wrong calls may have consequences.

    UI Interaction: Fullscreen feed viewing, in-game report log, and minimal diegetic HUD.

    Lore Integration: Discovery of logs, anomalies, and the diary of a vanished predecessor deepens the narrative.

Tools & Workflow

    Engine: Unity 6 (URP, Mobile optimized)

    Version Control: Git + GitHub

    Task Management: Trello

    UI/UX: TextMeshPro, custom surveillance overlay system

    Scripting: C# (modular architecture for entities, cameras, input handling)
